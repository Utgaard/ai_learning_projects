# Pixel Armies — Tasks

## Milestones

1. [ ] **Line-breaker mechanics**
   - [ ] SimCore: extend ability handling for reach, ranged, cleave/AoE, and on-death effects.
   - [ ] Scripts/Content: update unit data to include line-breaker abilities and tuned stats.
   - [ ] Presentation: add hooks for line-breaker visuals/feedback if needed.

2. [x] **Reliable Escalation & Debug Visibility**
   - [x] Time-based tier unlocking (tiers 2–4)
   - [x] Tier-weighted spawning
   - [x] Periodic debug readout (units per tier, base HP, sim time)

3. [ ] **Content Scalability**
   - [ ] Move armies and unit definitions to data (e.g. JSON or resources)
   - [ ] Enable rapid creation of many visually and mechanically distinct armies
   - [ ] Keep SimCore generic and content-agnostic
