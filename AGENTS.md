# Agent Instructions (Codex)

## Principles
- Prefer the simplest working solution.
- Small, incremental changes only.
- Keep code rookie-friendly and readable.
- Avoid new abstractions unless necessary.

## Workflow
- Only work on tasks that are explicitly labeled `codex-ready`.
- Follow the issue's "Files allowed to change" strictly.
- After implementing, ensure the project still runs.
- Commit with a clear message referencing the issue.

## Game projects
- Keep early iterations in a single file unless requested.
- No assets/sprites unless the task explicitly requests it.
